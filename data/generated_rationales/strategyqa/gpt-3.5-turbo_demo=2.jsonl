Astrology is based on the interpretation of the positions and movements of celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon, and planets, and their supposed influence on human behavior and events. The density of a planet does not have any significance in astrology, so it would not be a factor in determining the content of a horoscope."}

{"question": "Could Moulin Rouge have been hypothetically used as Spain's Spanish American War triage center?", "answer": "yes.", "rationale": "Moulin Rouge is a famous cabaret in Paris, France, which opened in 1889. The Spanish American War took place in 1898 and mainly involved the Spanish Empire and the United States. Therefore, it is impossible for Moulin Rouge to have been used as a triage center for the Spanish American War in Spain, as it is located in France and the war did not involve France."}
{"question": "Could largest ship from Voyages of Christopher Columbus haul Statue of Liberty?", "answer": "no.", "rationale": "The largest ship used by Christopher Columbus during his voyages was the Santa Maria, which had a cargo capacity of approximately 100 tons.

{"question": "Would you buy bananas for tostones?", "answer": "no.", "rationale": "Tostones are made from green plantains, not bananas.

Both can display randomness and chaos, making it understandable to draw a comparison between the two."}
{"question": "Are people more likely than normal to get sunburn at Burning Man?", "answer": "yes.", "rationale": "Burning Man is an annual event that takes place in the desert, where attendees are exposed to direct sunlight for extended periods of time.
